# A clustering/anomaly detection machine learning algorithm for near-shore ADCP data processing
Alexander Knysh, [github repository](https://github.com/alexanderknysh/adcpml)

## Description 
The following machine learning study aims to select several typical and several anomalous (less than 20-30 in total) loadcases from a detailed ADCP datasets obtained by the Wood Island research site, Maine, USA. Two ADCPs measured water depth, significant wave height and period, as well as north and east projections of current velocity profiles during a half of a month period. The detailed description of the machine learning algorithm and the corresponding interactive cloud code can be found in [this Google Colab notebook](https://github.com/alexanderknysh/adcpml/blob/main/adcpml.ipynb).
