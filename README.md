## A clustering/anomaly detection machine learning algorithm for near-shore Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data processing
The following machine learning study aims to select several typical and several anomalous (less than 20-30 in total) loadcases from a detailed ADCP datasets obtained by the Wood Island research site, Maine, USA. Two ADCPs measured water depth, significant wave height and period, as well as north and east projections of current velocity profiles during a half of a month period. More details on the research can be found in [Section 3.2 of this paper](https://github.com/alexanderknysh/adcpml/blob/main/paper.pdf).

The detailed description of the machine learning algorithm and the corresponding interactive cloud code can be found in [this Google Colab notebook](https://github.com/alexanderknysh/adcpml/blob/main/adcpml.ipynb).
